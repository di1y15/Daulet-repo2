# Before you begin, make sure 2 servers(master and slave) are up and running

# first step is to set a passwd for the signed user(centos in this example)

	1) run the command <sudo passwd centos> and set the passwd

# Generate the ssh keys on the master server

	2) run the command <sudo ssh-keygen -t rsa>

# After that, go to the slave server where you need to change the config file. In order to enable the authorication via ssh tunnel

	3) sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	uncomment #PasswordAuthentication yes and make sure it is set to "Yes"

# Then restart the sshd service

	4) restart systemctl restart sshd 

# Now copy the keys from your master server to slave server

	5) sudo ssh-copy-id centos@ip address

# Finally, you can ssh from the master to slave server

	6) sudo ssh centos@ip address
